## Introduction
Users are encouraged to visit our **ColoRandom** page for color palette inspiration for their next project. They can generate a completely random palette of five colors at a time, or save their desired colors and refresh the random colors of their choice around these saved options. All saved palettes will be shown in a sidebar for users to review as wished.

This project was assigned as a part of Turing School of Software and Design's Front-End program, students had one week to complete it.

## Technologies
  - Javascript
  - HTML
  - CSS
    - Flexbox
  - Inkscape
    - Used to create custom *lock* and *unlock* images.

## Features
- When a user initially opens the page, they'll see five random colors with their associated hexcodes, an empty **Saved Palettes** section, and two buttons labeled **New Palette** and **Save Palette**.
- To generate a completely new palette, the user can click **New Palette**. Five new colors will be displayed on the main screen.
- From there, the user can click on a color that they like to *lock* that color in place. Now, when they generate a new palette, every color except those that are locked will change. Clicking on a color again will *unlock* a locked color. (This is visually demonstrated with an unlocked or locked icon below each color.)
- When a user has a collection of colors that they're happy with, clicking **Save Palette** will move this palette into the Saved Palettes section. They can choose to remove any palette from this section by clicking the trash icon next to the appropriate palette.
